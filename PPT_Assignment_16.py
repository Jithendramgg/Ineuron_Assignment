ðŸ’¡ **Question 1**

Given an array, for each element find the value of the nearest element to the right which is having a frequency greater than that of the current element. If there does not exist an answer for a position, then make the value â€˜-1â€™.

**Examples:**

```
Input: a[] = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]
Output : [-1, -1, 1, 2, 2, 1, -1]

Explanation:
Given array a[] = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]
Frequency of each element is: 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3

Lets calls Next Greater Frequency element as NGF
1. For element a[0] = 1 which has a frequency = 3,
   As it has frequency of 3 and no other next element
   has frequency more than 3 so  '-1'
2. For element a[1] = 1 it will be -1 same logic
   like a[0]
3. For element a[2] = 2 which has frequency = 2,
   NGF element is 1 at position = 6  with frequency
   of 3 > 2
4. For element a[3] = 3 which has frequency = 1,
   NGF element is 2 at position = 5 with frequency
   of 2 > 1
5. For element a[4] = 4 which has frequency = 1,
   NGF element is 2 at position = 5 with frequency
   of 2 > 1
6. For element a[5] = 2 which has frequency = 2,
   NGF element is 1 at position = 6 with frequency
   of 3 > 2
7. For element a[6] = 1 there is no element to its
   right, hence -1
```

```
Input : a[] = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 11, 3, 3]
Output : [2, 2, 2, -1, -1, -1, -1, 3, -1, -1]
```

"""
ðŸ’¡ **Question 4**

Given a Queue consisting of firstÂ **n**Â natural numbers (in random order). The task is to check whether the given Queue elements can be arranged in increasing order in another Queue using a stack. The operation allowed are:

1. Push and pop elements from the stack
2. Pop (Or Dequeue) from the given Queue.
3. Push (Or Enqueue) in the another Queue.

**Examples :**

Input :Â Queue[] = { 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 }Â 

Output :Â YesÂ 

Pop the first element of the given Queue 

i.e 5.Â Push 5 into the stack.Â 

Now, pop all the elements of the given Queue and push them toÂ second Queue.Â 

Now, pop element 5 in the stack and push it to the second Queue.Â Â Â 

Input :Â Queue[] = { 5, 1, 2, 6, 3, 4 }Â 

Output :Â NoÂ 

Push 5 to stack.Â 

Pop 1, 2 from given Queue and push it to another Queue.Â 

Pop 6 from given Queue and push to stack.Â 

Pop 3, 4 from given Queue and push to second Queue.Â 

Now, from using any of above operation, we cannot push 5Â into the second Queue because it is below the 6 in the stack.

"""
ðŸ’¡ **Question 8**

Given an array of integers, the task is to find the maximum absolute difference between the nearest left and the right smaller element of every element in the array.

**Note:**Â If there is no smaller element on right side or left side of any element then we take zero as the smaller element. For example for the leftmost element, the nearest smaller element on the left side is considered as 0. Similarly, for rightmost elements, the smaller element on the right side is considered as 0.

**Examples:**
0
```
Input : arr[] = {2, 1, 8}
Output : 1
Left smaller  LS[] {0, 0, 1}
Right smaller RS[] {1, 0, 0}
Maximum Diff of abs(LS[i] - RS[i]) = 1

Input  : arr[] = {2, 4, 8, 7, 7, 9, 3}
Output : 4
Left smaller   LS[] = {0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 7, 2}
Right smaller  RS[] = {0, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 0}
Maximum Diff of abs(LS[i] - RS[i]) = 7 - 3 = 4
