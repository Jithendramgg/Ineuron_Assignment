## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans: General purpose means that python can be used broadly without concluding to one specific application or problem. 
And It is known as hih-level programming because of easy unnderstandable by humans and easy to read.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Reason is the variable declaration and initialization can be done anywhere in the program.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans :pros : easily readable, simple syntax, vast libraries
     cons: speed limitation, if the error is in 200th line all the other steps run Since It is not complied but interpretated. 

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans: Data Science, Web Applications, scripting

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans: Variables are memory pointer of the data, in python we can dynamically declare variables in any place of program.


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans : we can take input from user by using input() function.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans: Default datatype of input function is string class

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Changing the one datatype to Another 

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Ans: Yes, We can use split function to take mutliple inputs in a single input() function.

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: Special reserved Characters, which have a purpose in programs.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans: We can't use keywords as variable, It will throw syntax error and wont serve the purpose of keywords 

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans: Identations are the spaces in brgining of the code, If Identation is not followed python will throw error. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans: using print() function.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans: Operators are the values we use to manipulate the values of operands 

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans: / is the division operator It will have decimal values based on operands, // is also division but it floors the value to interger.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans: print('''```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```''')

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans: 
num = int(input("Please enter a number :"))
if num%2 == 0:
    print("Given Number is Even")
else:
    print("Given Number is Odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans: OR, AND and NOT are boolean operators, because these produce bool type(0,1) as results.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```
Ans: 
1
0
False
1

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans: which will decide the flow based on condition of the expressions. if, elif, else

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans: This is crucial in deciding the decision box of the flow in the program. 

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans:
age = int(input("Enter your age : "))
if(age>=18):
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")
	

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans:
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
output=[]
for i in numbers:
    if i%2 == 0:
        output.append(i)
print(output)


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans:
u_inp = list(map(int,input("Enter numbers with space in between : ").split()))
print(u_inp)

for i in range(0,len(u_inp)+1):
    print("i value is ",i)
    print("i+1 value is ",i+1)
    if(i+1>=len(u_inp)):
        break
    else:
        if(u_inp[i]>u_inp[i+1]):
            max1 = u_inp[i]
        else:
            max1 = u_inp[i+1]
print("maximum value in the entered numbers is ", max1)         
          

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans:
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
output= []
for i in numbers:    
    if i%5==0 and i<150:
        output.append(i)
    elif i>500:
            break
 
print(output)
