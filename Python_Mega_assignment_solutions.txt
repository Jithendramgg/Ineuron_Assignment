## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans: General purpose means that python can be used broadly without concluding to one specific application or problem. 
And It is known as hih-level programming because of easy unnderstandable by humans and easy to read.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Reason is the variable declaration and initialization can be done anywhere in the program.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans :pros : easily readable, simple syntax, vast libraries
     cons: speed limitation, if the error is in 200th line all the other steps run Since It is not complied but interpretated. 

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans: Data Science, Web Applications, scripting

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans: Variables are memory pointer of the data, in python we can dynamically declare variables in any place of program.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans : we can take input from user by using input() function.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans: Default datatype of input function is string class

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Changing the one datatype to Another 

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans: Yes, We can use split function to take mutliple inputs in a single input() function.

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: Special reserved Characters, which have a purpose in programs.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans: We can't use keywords as variable, It will throw syntax error and wont serve the purpose of keywords 

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans: Identations are the spaces in brgining of the code, If Identation is not followed python will throw error. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans: using print() function.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans: Operators are the values we use to manipulate the values of operands 

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans: / is the division operator It will have decimal values based on operands, // is also division but it floors the value to interger.

if num%2 == 0:
    print("Given Number is Even")
else:
    print("Given Number is Odd")


Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans: OR, AND and NOT are boolean operators, because these produce bool type(0,1) as results.

Q19. What will the output of the following?

0
False
1


Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans: which will decide the flow based on condition of the expressions. if, elif, else

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans: This is crucial in deciding the decision box of the flow in the program.
